# IT Essentials Repository

Welcome to my IT Essentials Repository! My name is Aaron and I'm excited to share with you the most widely-used open source tools in the industry that cover all of the important components of IT.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware

### Open Hardware Monitor

The Open Hardware Monitor is a free open source software that monitors temperature sensors, fan speeds, voltages, load and clock speeds of computer components. It's important to have this tool to ensure that the hardware components are working optimally and prevent damage due to overheating.

### Alternative: HWMonitor
HWMonitor is a free hardware monitoring program that reads PC systems' main health sensors, such as CPU temperature, voltage, power consumption, and utilization.

## üíª Software

## üê≥ Docker

### Introduction

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, run, and share applications with containers. The use of containers to deploy applications is called containerization. Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

### Benefits of Docker

- **Fast:** Containers can be started in seconds, as opposed to the minutes it can take to start up a virtual machine.
- **Lightweight:** Containers share the host operating system kernel, so they don't require an operating system to be installed inside them. This makes containers very lightweight and efficient.
- **Flexible:** Containers can be easily moved between environments, such as from development to production, or from a local machine to a cloud provider.

### Getting Started with Docker

To get started with Docker, you'll need to install the Docker engine on your machine. Visit the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/) for installation instructions and documentation.

## üîß Ansible

### Introduction

Ansible is a powerful automation tool that can be used to manage configuration and deployments on multiple servers. It's designed to be simple to use and can be easily integrated with other automation tools.

### Benefits of Ansible

- **Simple:** Ansible uses a simple syntax called YAML to describe configuration and deployment tasks. This makes it easy to learn and use.
- **Agentless:** Unlike other automation tools, Ansible does not require an agent to be installed on the target machines. This makes it easy to deploy and manage.
- **Powerful:** Ansible has a rich set of modules and plugins that can be used to automate complex tasks.

### Getting Started with Ansible

To get started with Ansible, you'll need to install the Ansible engine on your machine. Visit the [official Ansible website](https://www.ansible.com/) for installation instructions and documentation.

## üêô Git

### Introduction

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It's designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### Benefits of Git

- **Distributed:** Git is a distributed version control system, which means that every user has a complete copy of the repository. This makes it easy to collaborate on projects and work offline.
- **Fast:** Git is very fast, even for very large repositories.
- **Flexible:** Git is very flexible and can be used for a wide range of projects, from small personal projects to large enterprise projects.

### Getting Started with Git

To get started with Git, you'll need to install the Git client on your machine. Visit the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/) for installation instructions and documentation.

## üì¶ VirtualBox

### Introduction

VirtualBox is a free and open source virtualization software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on your computer at the same time. It's important to have this tool to create virtual environments for testing, development, and experimentation.

### Benefits of VirtualBox

- **Free:** VirtualBox is free and open source.
- **Flexible:** VirtualBox can be used to create virtual environments for a wide range of use cases, from testing and development to running legacy applications.
- **Cross-Platform:** VirtualBox can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris.

### Getting Started with VirtualBox

To get started with VirtualBox, you'll need to download and install it on your machine. Visit the [official VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for installation instructions and documentation.

## üì° Telecommunications

### Wireshark

Wireshark is a free and open source network protocol analyzer that allows you to see what's happening on your network at a microscopic level. It's important to have this tool to analyze network traffic, troubleshoot issues and detect security vulnerabilities.

### Alternative: tcpdump
tcpdump is a free and open source command-line packet analyzer. It can capture and display packet information on the network interface and can be used to troubleshoot and debug network issues.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database/Warehouses

### MySQL

MySQL is a free and open source relational database management system. It's important to have this tool to store and manage data, and is commonly used in web applications and content management systems.

### Alternative: PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a free and open source object-relational database management system. It offers advanced features such
